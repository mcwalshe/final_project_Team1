Change Log:
======================================================================================

John:

	10/30/17 - JLU - Completed initial work on the following items:
					MainGUI design
					Main menus
					Menu event handlers are present, but devoid of much action.
	
	10/31/17 - JLU - Completed initial work on the following items:
					Document List panel
					Document Statistic panel
					Document Reader panel
					Moved JFrame to undecorated and setup DragListener.
					Setup font size change framework for document reading panel (look @ this with Matthias, there's got to be a better way).
					Setup time capture for document statistics (Today's Training Time, Current WPM, Fastest WPM Today).
					
TBD:
	~Add all Keyboard Event Listeners
	~Setup minimize, maximize, exit buttons on the title bar
	~setup some sort of prototype transparent z overlay
	~(Talk w/ Matthias) Since textArea auto-resizes on font size change, and undecorated JFrame doesn't, need to find a good way to dynamically resize textArea.  Currently empirically setting rows/cols.
	~Finish document based stats collection
